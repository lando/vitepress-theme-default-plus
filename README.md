# VuePress 2 Default Theme +

This extends the [default VuePress 2 theme](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/reference/default-theme/config.html#basic-config) with some extra power and features such as:

* Automatically generated and customizable _Previous Versions_ page
* Automatically generated and customizable _Contributorz_ page
* Some basic documentation versioning features
* Features to help combining different docs sites into a single coherent docs experience
* A configurable _Special Sponsors_ section
* [CarbonAds](https://www.carbonads.net/) support

Note that autogeneration of contributors and versioning information currently only works with GitHub. You can, however, manually populate these values for other VCS for now.
