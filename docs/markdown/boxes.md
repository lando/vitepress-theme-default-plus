# Box Containers

Boxes are basically [admonitions](./admonitions.md) without the title and are about the _color_ instead of the _type_.

::: box
This is a box.
:::

::: box-blue
This is a blue box.
:::

::: box-brand
This is a brand box.
:::

::: box-green
This is a green box.
:::

::: box-red
This is a red box.
:::

::: box-yellow
This is a yellow box.
:::

The above is achieved with the following markdown:

```md
::: box
This is a box.
:::

::: box-blue
This is a blue box.
:::

::: box-brand
This is a brand box.
:::

::: box-green
This is a green box.
:::

::: box-red
This is a red box.
:::

::: box-yellow
This is a yellow box.
:::
```
