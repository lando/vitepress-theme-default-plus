# Making a guide

Guides are _how tos_ or _tutorials_ that fit somewhere in between technical documentation and blog posts. They generally
seek to answer a single question such as "How do I create a guide using this theme?" and are heavy on code snippets.

In this case there are actually two ways to create a guide:

* Autopopulating data from the `git log`.
* [Manually entering data](./making-a-guide-2.html)

## Autopopulating data from `git log`

You don't really have to do anything. Just make a commit to this page and you will show up like `Mike Pirog` does for this one. If you want to augment the `git log` data you should check out [this](../config/config#contributors).

If you are interested in manually setting the `authors`, `date` and edit link then check out [Making a Guide 2](./making-a-guide-2.html)
